        <p>Psychological Benefits:
          Children who own pets are often less self centred than those who do not.
          Psychiatrically ill people were happier as a result of looking after a pet.

          Social Benefits:
          Pets provide companionship and promote a general feeling of well being, for example pets in residential
          homes improve both patient and staff morale. </p>
        <h4>There are some ideas about the benefits of keepinga cat.</h4>
        <p>If you have ever had a cat，or have watched one of the many funny cat videos online，you'll know that cats have
          a mind of their own．A lot of the
          things they do are hard to understand---they like to climb up tall furniture，fit themselves in small spaces
          and attack small objects for no reason at all．</p>
